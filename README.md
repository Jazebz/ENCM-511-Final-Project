# Fancy Countdown Timer – ENCM 511 Fall 2025 (FreeRTOS Project)

This project is a working implementation of a FreeRTOS based finite state machine running on PIC24 hardware using MPlab.
The system acts as a countdown timer controlled by different push buttons, a potentiometer, UART terminal input, and three LEDs with PWM.

This repository has all the source code, diagrams, and documentation for the final group project.
